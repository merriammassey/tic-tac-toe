# tic-tac-toe

## Description

To begin learning functional programming, I created this tic-tac-toe game using Haskell.

In Haskell, the program is written in declarative code. The program is a single expression that is executed when the expression is evaluated. With lazy expression, the expression is not evaluated until it is used, which can result in perfomance gains.
